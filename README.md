# Bitrise Step - GitHub Release Asset Upload

[![Step changelog](https://shields.io/github/v/release/invoice-simple/bitrise-step-upload-asset-github-release?include_prereleases&label=changelog&color=blueviolet)](https://github.com/invoice-simple/bitrise-step-upload-asset-github-release/releases)

Upload your mobile app assets (.apk and .ipa files) to an existing GitHub Release.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

This Bitrise Step uploads your mobile app binaries to an existing GitHub Release. It works with both APK (Android) and IPA (iOS) files, automatically filtering out other file types for focused asset management.

Please note that this Step requires an **existing GitHub Release** to be created beforehand. The Step will upload assets to the release identified by the provided tag name. If you would like to create a GitHub release including assets, use the [GitHub Release](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/github-release) step instead.

### Configuring the Step

This Step uses GitHub's API, so you need to set up proper authentication and permissions:

#### Setting up GitHub API Access

1. **Create a Personal Access Token**:

   - Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Generate a new token with `repo` scope (for private repositories) or `public_repo` scope (for public repositories)
   - Store the token securely as a [Secret Environment Variable](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/env-vars-secret-env-vars/) in Bitrise

2. **Ensure Release Exists**:
   - The GitHub Release must already exist with the specified tag
   - You can create releases manually via GitHub's web interface or use GitHub's API/CLI tools
   - The Step will fail if the specified tag/release doesn't exist

#### Required Permissions

Your GitHub token must have the following permissions:

- **Contents**: Write (to upload release assets)
- **Metadata**: Read (to access repository information)

For private repositories, ensure the token has full `repo` access.

### Step Configuration

To deploy your app assets with the Step:

1. **GitHub Repository Path**: Set this to your repository in `owner/repo` format (e.g., `mycompany/myapp`)
2. **GitHub Personal Access Token**: Add the Secret Environment Variable containing your GitHub token
3. **Deploy directory or file path**: Specify the path to your built assets (defaults to `$BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR`)
4. **Release Tag**: Provide the tag name of the existing GitHub Release where assets should be uploaded

### File Filtering

The Step automatically filters files to upload only mobile app binaries:

- **Android**: `.apk` files
- **iOS**: `.ipa` files
- **Other files** in the deploy directory are automatically skipped

### Troubleshooting

If the Step fails, check the following:

- **Authentication**: Verify your GitHub token is valid and has the correct permissions
- **Release Existence**: Ensure a release with the specified tag already exists in the repository
- **Repository Path**: Check the repository path format is correct (`owner/repo`)
- **File Permissions**: Verify the deploy path contains readable `.apk` or `.ipa` files
- **Network**: Ensure the build environment has internet access to reach GitHub's API

Common error scenarios:

- **404 Not Found**: Release with the specified tag doesn't exist
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid or expired GitHub token
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Asset may already exist with the same name

        - variant: release
        - build_type: apk
  - sign-apk:
      inputs:
        - android_app: $BITRISE_APK_PATH

  # Build iOS IPA
  - xcode-archive:
      inputs:
        - scheme: MyApp
  - export-xcarchive:
      inputs:
        - export_method: app-store

  # Upload assets to GitHub Release
  - git::https://github.com/invoice-simple/bitrise-step-upload-asset-github-release.git@master:
      inputs:
        - github_repo: mycompany/myapp
```
